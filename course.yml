title: Application Case Study 10 SQL Interview Questions
description: During your interview for an analyst position at Instacart, they ask you 
to write a query that answers the following business question, "Are items that were re-ordered added to the cart sooner
than items that were not re-ordered?" There's almost no technical language in that question, and certainly no 
SQL keywords! It can be tough to translate business questions into SQL queries, but we do just that in this 
case study. We'll cover the tools necessary for confidently crafting SQL queries that solve interview-style questions. 
This course is also excellent for anyone who wants to generally practice translating business questions into SQL queries. 
We'll review more advanced SQL concepts like GROUP BY, JOINs, CASE statements, and learn to properly choose the correct 
command for a given business/interview question.
