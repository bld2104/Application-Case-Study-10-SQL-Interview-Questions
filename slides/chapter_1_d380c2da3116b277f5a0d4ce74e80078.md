## Review of INNER JOINs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2f8ab8aaee"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
We already covered INNER JOINs. As a reminder, an INNER join keeps only rows that two tables have in common.

## Introduction to LEFT JOINs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ff5ec0f07f"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
A LEFT JOIN keeps everything from the left table (_**no matter what!**_) and only matches up rows from the right table that can be found in the left table, based on the column you're comparing.

## LEFT JOIN Syntax

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "93548e361d"
```

`@part1`
Here's how we write the code for a LEFT JOIN (to the right).{{4}}

The table literally to the left of the words "LEFT JOIN" is the left table. So, in this case, table1 is the LEFT table.{{5}}

As with any JOIN, we also need to choose a column for SQL to compare in order to complete the JOIN (the ON statement).{{6}}


`@part2`
```SELECT *```{{1}}

```FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2```{{2}}

```ON table1.id = table2.id```{{3}}


`@script`

## LEFT JOIN Example

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ea5f867f9f"
```

`@part1`
Let's go through a business example. 

You work for a small widget company. Your company has a database with several tables in it. 

We'll focus in on two of these tables: the sales table, and the contacts table.


`@script`

## The Sales Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d9a836b2a8"
```

`@part1`
The sales table has 10 rows, each row represents a unique sale made by your company. Notice it contains a contact_id which identifies the person that made the sale.

`@script`



---
## The Contacts Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "09cc691bbd"
```

`@part1`
The contacts table has 20 rows, and each row represents a unique contact/person. Note that not all of of your company's contacts may have purchased something from your company.

## Contacts as the Left Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a8af8c5f6b"
```

`@part1`
What happens if we perform a LEFT JOIN on these two tables, with the contacts table as the left table? This is what the syntax would look like if we select all of the columns: {{1}}

``` SELECT *``` {{2}}

```FROM contacts LEFT JOIN sales```{{3}}

```ON sales.contact_id = contacts.contact_id```{{4}}

This will show all the columns and rows from the left table, and to the right of that, all columns from the right table and only rows from the right table that match the left table based on contact_id.{{5}}


`@script`



---
## Contacts as the Left Table (continued)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "3ae40364df"
```

`@part1`
Here's what the result would look like. Notice that all of the contacts are in the result (we kept everything from the left table, the contacts table), but there are several NULLs in the sales columns. That means that those contacts never bought anything from the company.

## Sales as the Left Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c53cf389a8"
```

`@part1`
What happens if we perform a LEFT JOIN on these two tables, with the Sales table as the left table? This is what the syntax would look like if we select all of the columns:{{1}}

``` SELECT * ```{{2}}

```FROM sales LEFT JOIN contacts```{{3}}

``` ON sales.contact_id = contacts.contact_id ``` {{4}}


`@script`



---
## Sales as the Left Table _(continued)_

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d0270999d4"
```

`@part1`
And this is what the result would look like. We keep everything from the sales table since it's the left once, and only pull in information from the contacts table that matches. So, not all contacts are appearing since not all of them made a purchase.
