## Review of INNER JOINs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2f8ab8aaee"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
We already covered INNER JOINs. As a reminder, an INNER join keeps only rows that two tables have in common.

## Introduction to LEFT JOINs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ff5ec0f07f"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
A LEFT JOIN keeps everything from the left table (no matter what!) and only adds rows from the right table that match rows in the left table, based on the column you're comparing.

## LEFT JOIN Syntax

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "93548e361d"
```

`@part1`
The syntax is similar to an INNER JOIN:

In the query, we choose a left table (the table literally to the left of the words "LEFT JOIN") and a right table. We also need to choose a column for SQL to compare in order to complete the JOIN.


`@part2`
```SELECT *
FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.id = table2.id
```
