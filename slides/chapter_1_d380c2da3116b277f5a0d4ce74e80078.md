`@script`
Welcome to this lesson on LEFT JOINs in SQL! We'll walk through the syntax for LEFT JOINs, and conceptualize how they work.

## Review of INNER JOINs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2f8ab8aaee"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
As a reminder, an INNER join keeps only rows that two tables have in common.

`@script`
We already covered INNER JOINs. Recall that an INNER JOIN only keeps rows that the two tables being joined together have in common, based on the column you specify to compare.

## Introduction to LEFT JOINs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ff5ec0f07f"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
A LEFT JOIN keeps everything from the left table (_**no matter what!**_) and only matches up rows from the right table that can be found in the left table.
![https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/left-join.png?raw=true](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/left-join.png?raw=true)


`@script`
A LEFT JOIN, on the other hand, keeps all rows from the LEFT table, no matter what, and only pulls in rows from the RIGHT table that match the LEFT table, again based on the column you tell SQL to compare.

## The Sales Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d9a836b2a8"
```

`@part1`
- 10 rows
- Each row represents a unique sale made by your company. 
- The contact_id column identifies the person that made the purchase.
![Sales Table](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/sales_table.png?raw=true)


`@script`
Let's go through a few interview examples together. You are presented with a database with two tables in it. The SALES table has 10 rows of data, and each row represents a unique sale made by the company. It has a contact_id column to identify the customer who made the purchase.


---
## The Contacts Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "09cc691bbd"
```

`@part1`
- 20 rows
- Each row represents a unique contact/person. 
- Not all of of your company's contacts may have made a purchase.
 ![Contacts Table](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/final_contacts_table.png?raw=true)


`@script`
The contacts table has 20 rows, and each row represents a unique person that has interacted with the company in some way. This table also has a contact_id column, which is what we'll use to LEFT JOIN this table to the sales table. Note that we have more contacts than sales - not all of the company's contacts may have purchased something.

## Interview Question Example 1

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "915d3c1b77"
```

`@part1`
Your boss asks: "**What percentage of contacts made a purchase?**" 

![Formula to Answer Question](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/formula-question-1.png?raw=true)
_Therefore, we need the entire contacts table._


`@script`
The interviewer asks you what percentage of the company's contacts made a purchase. To start, we'll define the percentage: we need the number of purchases divided by the total number of contacts. Since the denominator of the percentage is all contacts, we need all rows from the CONTACTS table. That's our clue that a LEFT JOIN will be useful here - an INNER JOIN wouldn't bring back all contacts, only contacts who made a purchase.


---
## Contacts as the Left Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a8af8c5f6b"
```

`@part1`
``` SELECT count(sale_id)/count(contacts.contact_id) AS percentage_sales``` {{1}}

```FROM contacts LEFT JOIN sales```{{2}}

```ON sales.contact_id = contacts.contact_id```{{3}}

![Percentage Result](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/result_percentage_query.png?raw=true){{4}}


`@script`
The SELECT statement counts the rows that have a sale_id (number of sales) divided by all rows that have a contact_id (total contacts). The full query looks like this, and would return .5:

## Side note: verify your results

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "3ae40364df"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
There are a few ways you could double-check this result:

**Add each piece of the equation:**

```SELECT COUNT(sale_id) AS num_sales, COUNT(contacts.contact_id) AS total_contacts, COUNT(sale_id)/COUNT(contacts.contact_id) AS percentage_sales```

```FROM contacts LEFT JOIN sales```

```ON contacts.contact_id = sales.contact_id```

![](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/result_verify_numbers.png?raw=true)


`@script`
There are a few ways you could double-check this result. By adding each count to the SELECT statement, we can verify that the numbers are what we'd expect, given the data.


---
## Side note: verify your results

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b1790e946c"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
There are a few ways you could double-check this result:

**Do a SELECT *:**

_(This is easier with smaller datasets.)_

 ![Contacts Left Table JOIN](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/contacts_left_table.png?raw=true)


`@script`
We could also select all columns before or after computing the percentage, to verify that the query returns all the columns and rows from the contacts table, and rows from the sales table that match based on contact_id lined up to the right of that. The NULLs in the sales columns indicate that those contacts never bought anything from the company.


---
## Interview Question Example 2

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "5a964851a2"
```

`@part1`
Now, your boss asks "**Can you give me a list of email addresses of all contacts who made a purchase?**"

``` SELECT email```

```FROM sales LEFT JOIN contacts```

``` on sales.contact_id = contacts.contact_id```


`@script`
Next, the interviewer asks for a list of email addresses for contacts who made a purchase. To answer that we only want to return contacts who are in the sales table. So, we'll flip the order of the tables - we'll choose SALES as the LEFT table this time.


---
## Sales as the Left Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d0270999d4"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
``` SELECT * ```

```FROM sales LEFT JOIN contacts```

``` ON sales.contact_id = contacts.contact_id ```

![Sales Left Table JOIN](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/sales_left_table.png?raw=true)


`@script`
Again, we can do a SELECT * to verify. This is what the result would look like. The LEFT JOIN is keeping everything from the sales table since it's the left one this time, and only pulling in rows from the contacts table that match based on contact_id. Therefore, only information about contacts who made a purchase is appearing.


---
## Compare the Results

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "f4ea56199d"
```

`@part1`
Percentage of contacts who purchased something.
![Contacts Left Table JOIN](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/contacts_left_table.png?raw=true)


`@part2`
Email addresses of contacts who purchased something.
![Sales Left Table JOIN](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/sales_left_table.png?raw=true)


`@script`
Here's a quick look at the SELECT * for each interview question side-by-side for comparison: they look very different don't they? Unlike INNER JOINs, the order of the tables matters for LEFT JOINs, and you may get a different result depending on the data if you flip the tables.

## Now let's practice!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "6bff76e8f7"
```

`@script`
We've gone through a couple of example interview questions together. Now, try to practice this on your own!
