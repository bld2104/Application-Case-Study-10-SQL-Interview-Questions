`@script`
Welcome to this lesson on LEFT JOINs in SQL! We'll walk through the syntax for LEFT JOINs, and conceptualize how they work.

## Review of INNER JOINs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2f8ab8aaee"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
We already covered INNER JOINs. As a reminder, an INNER join keeps only rows that two tables have in common.

`@script`
Let's do a quick review of what you learned in the last lesson - INNER JOINs. Recall that an INNER JOIN only keeps rows that the two tables being joined together have in common, based on the column you specify to compare.

## Introduction to LEFT JOINs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "ff5ec0f07f"
center_content: true
```

`@part1`
A LEFT JOIN keeps everything from the left table (_**no matter what!**_) and only matches up rows from the right table that can be found in the left table.

`@script`
A LEFT JOIN, on the other hand, keeps all rows from the LEFT table, no matter what, and only pulls in rows from the RIGHT table that match the LEFT table, again based on the column you tell SQL to compare.

## LEFT JOIN Syntax

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "93548e361d"
```

`@part1`
Here's how we write the code for a LEFT JOIN:{{1}}


**Note: **The table literally to the left of the words "LEFT JOIN" is the left table. {{5}}


`@part2`
```SELECT *```{{2}}

```FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2```{{3}}

```ON table1.id = table2.id```{{4}}


`@script`
Here's the syntax for a LEFT JOIN. It's pretty much identical to the syntax for an INNER JOIN, except we specify LEFT instead of INNER in the FROM statement. The table literally to the left of the words "LEFT JOIN" is the left table. So, in this example, table1 is the LEFT table and table2 is the right table.

## The Sales Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d9a836b2a8"
```

`@part1`
- 10 rows
- Each row represents a unique sale made by your company. 
- The contact_id column identifies the person that made the purchase.
![Sales Table](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/sales_table.png?raw=true)


`@script`
Let's go through a business example. Your company has a database with two tables in it. The first table is this sales table. Notice that it has 10 rows of data, and that each row represents a unique sale made by your company. Also note that it has a contact_id column to identify the person who made the purchase.


---
## The Contacts Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "09cc691bbd"
```

`@part1`
- 20 rows
- Each row represents a unique contact/person. 
- Not all of of your company's contacts may have made a purchase.
 ![Contacts Table](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/contacts_table.png?raw=true)


`@script`
The contacts table has 20 rows, and each row represents a unique person that has interacted with your company in some way. This table also has a contact_id column, which is what we'll use to LEFT JOIN this table to the sales table. Note that we have more contacts than sales - not all of your company's contacts may have purchased something.


---
## Contacts as the Left Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "a8af8c5f6b"
```

`@part1`
``` SELECT *``` {{1}}

```FROM contacts LEFT JOIN sales```{{2}}

```ON sales.contact_id = contacts.contact_id```{{3}}


`@script`
What happens if we perform a LEFT JOIN on these two tables, with the contacts table as the left table? This is what the syntax would look like if we select all of the columns...


---
## Contacts as the Left Table (continued)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "3ae40364df"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
``` SELECT *```

```FROM contacts LEFT JOIN sales```

```ON sales.contact_id = contacts.contact_id```

 ![Contacts Left Table JOIN](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/contacts-left-table-join.png?raw=true)


`@script`
And here's what the result would look like. This query will show all the columns and rows from the left table. Lined up to the right of that are all rows from the right table that match the left table based on contact_id, and all columns from the right table since we chose SELECT *. Notice that there are several NULLs in the sales columns. That means that those contacts didn't have a match in the sales table - in other words, they never bought anything from the company.


---
## Sales as the Left Table

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "c53cf389a8"
```

`@part1`
``` SELECT * ```{{2}}

```FROM sales LEFT JOIN contacts```{{3}}

``` ON sales.contact_id = contacts.contact_id ``` {{4}}


`@script`
Now, let's flip the order of the tables and perform a LEFT JOIN with the Sales table as the left table. This is what the syntax would look like if we select all of the columns:


---
## Sales as the Left Table _(continued)_

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "d0270999d4"
disable_transition: true
```

`@part1`
``` SELECT * ```

```FROM sales LEFT JOIN contacts```

``` ON sales.contact_id = contacts.contact_id ```

![Sales Left Table JOIN](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/sales-left-table-join.png?raw=true)


`@script`
And this is what the result would look like. We keep everything from the sales table since it's the left one this time, and only pull in rows from the contacts table that match based on contact_id. Not all contacts are appearing since not all of them made a purchase.

## Compare the Results

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "f4ea56199d"
```

`@part1`
![Contacts Left Table JOIN](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/contacts-left-table-join.png?raw=true)


`@part2`
![Sales Left Table JOIN](https://github.com/bld2104/datacamp-10-sql-interview-questions/blob/master/course_Images/sales-left-table-join.png?raw=true)


`@script`
Take a look at the two results side-by-side: they look very different don't they? Unlike INNER JOINs, the order of the tables matters for LEFT JOINs, and you may get a different result depending on the data if you flip the tables.


---
## That's it!

```yaml
type: "FinalSlide"
key: "6bff76e8f7"
```

`@script`
That's all for LEFT JOINs - we'll move on to OUTER JOINs in the next lesson.
