## Introduction to Left JOINs

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "2f8ab8aaee"
```

`@part1`
We already covered INNER JOINs. As a reminder, an INNER join keeps only rows that two tables have in common.

A LEFT JOIN keeps everything from the left table (no matter what!) and only adds rows from the right table that match rows in the left table, based on the column you're comparing.

## LEFT JOIN Syntax

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "93548e361d"

`@part1`
The syntax is similar to an INNER JOIN:


`@part2`
```SELECT *
FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2
ON table1.id = table2.id
```
